      I am here to add value and help grow your business,
      promising to doing honest, quality work at a
      reasonable price and timeline. What sets me apart is
      that I employ humility and willingness to learn and

    <h3 class="section-header">Small business needs</h3>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      It can be difficult for small businesses to promote
      themselves on the web. You either hire a firm, jumping
      through flaming hoops of technicalities and unnecessary
      hidden charges like an acrobat made of dollar bills, or
      you spend time creating and maintaining it yourself
      instead of running your actual business. I delight in
      making this process as painless as possible for the
      small business.

    <h3 class="section-header">Hired hand needs</h3>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
      Do you have a product that needs to be maintained,
      updated, or just need the extra hands to bring your
      product to fruition? All the work I do is on paper so
      you can have peace of mind with my work, knowing great
      quality and attention to detail went into every piece.
