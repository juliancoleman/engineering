          This handbook is an outline of years of personal experience
          using the JavaScript programming language. It's a completely
          free resource for anyone to use and adhere to, whether you're
          an engineer trying to make a difference in your company, or
          you're the CEO of a startup and can't seem to figure out how
          to keep your engineers happy.
