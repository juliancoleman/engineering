          This handbook is an outline of years of personal experience
          using the JavaScript programming language. It's a completely
          free resource for anyone to use and adhere to, whether you're
          an engineer trying to make a difference in your company, or
          you're the CEO of a startup and can't seem to figure out how
          to keep your engineers happy.

          The purpose of this handbook is to establish consistency
          and uniformity among the team throughout project
          development, as well as to educate engineers on best
          practices, communication techniques, and to ultimately
          grow engineers so that they can teach other engineers to
          be 10 times better engineers.
