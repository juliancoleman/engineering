          Well, I can't believe I even have to write a post about this
          one. Back in late 2016 to just before the summer of 2017,
          the company I worked for gave me the task of building an app
          that essentially the business ran on. This app handled all
          the finances&mdash;paying employees, charging students, etc.
          &mdash;as well as a number of really important things that
          allowed our company to run and function as a business. If
          this app ever went down, we could lose between $80,000 to
          $1.5M in a very short time. For the sake of anonymity and
          respect for those involved, I won't name the company, and
          I'll dub the project <code>Purple Buddy</code>.
