          Well, I can't believe I even have to write a post about this
          one. Back in late 2016 to just before the summer of 2017,
          the company I worked for gave me the task of building an app
          that essentially the business ran on. This app handled all
          the finances&mdash;paying employees, charging students, etc.
          &mdash;as well as a number of really important things that
          allowed our company to run and function as a business. If
          this app ever went down, we could lose between $80,000 to
          $1.5M in a very short time. For the sake of anonymity and
          respect for those involved, I won't name the company, and
          I'll dub the project `Purple Buddy`.

          I'll be comparing why these two are often confused and how
          to not be so confused next time you're working on a project
          that this argument arises. Our first candidate is
          <code>MongoDB</code>, versus <code>Joi</code> and
          <code>SQL</code>.

          Let's take a minute to talk about what a <code>Model</code>
          is. The best way that I could define a model is similar to
          actually looking at a <em>clay model.</em> The model has
          curves and edges, personality, and a shape. It has
          <em>structure.</em> Everything that can be known about the
          model can be seen superficially, as well as have some
          visceral mechanics that aren't typically seen. These are
          often represented by <code>virtuals</code>,
          <code>methods</code>, and <code>relations</code>. While they
          pertain to the model itself, models are really just
          <em>prototypes</em>, similar to <code>classes</code> or
          <code>primitives</code> in JavaScript.

          Now that we've covered what a <code>Model</code> is, let's
          switch gears to <code>Schema</code>s.
